"""Arithmetic as Excel's x87 floating-point unit does it, in 80-bit
registers with a 64-bit mantissa.

Every operation Excel performs is rounded twice: to the register's 64 bits,
then to a double when the result is stored. The second rounding usually
changes nothing, but when the exact result lies within 2^-12 of a unit of
the midpoint between two doubles, the first rounding puts it exactly on the
midpoint and the second goes to the even side, which is sometimes the other
side. Measured on crafted cases: ``+``, ``*``, ``/`` and SQRT, SUM,
AVERAGE, PRODUCT and SUMSQ all round twice, 84 of 84, each step stored
before the next. :func:`add`, :func:`multiply`, :func:`divide` and
:func:`square_root` do the same, fast unless a result is near such a tie.

SIN, COS and TAN reduce their argument with pi to 64 bits, the x87's own
constant. ATAN, and the reciprocal a negative power is taken through, show
the double rounding too: ``8^(-1/3)`` is exactly 0.5 because
``1/1.9999999999999998`` rounds to 64 bits as a tie.

The exact paths work in :class:`~fractions.Fraction` and
:class:`~decimal.Decimal` at forty-odd digits, far more than a double
needs, and round once to 64 bits and once to a double at the end.
