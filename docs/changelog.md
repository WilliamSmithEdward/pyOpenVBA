# Changelog

All notable changes to pyOpenVBA are documented here. This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **Excel rejected modules whose source spanned more than one 4 KB chunk**
  with *"An error occurred while loading <Module>"*. The MS-OVBA compressor
  was emitting raw (CompressedChunkFlag = 0) chunks for full 4096-byte
  blocks. Although spec-legal, Office itself never writes raw chunks for
  module source streams -- empirically confirmed against an Excel-authored
  workbook containing a 16,881-byte module (all five of its chunks were
  token-compressed). The compressor now always emits token-compressed
  (flag = 1) chunks for module source; raw chunks remain only as a fallback
  for adversarial 4096-byte high-entropy input that overflows LZ encoding.
- **Re-running an add-module workflow after a delete produced duplicate
  `PROJECT` entries**, which Excel treats as corruption. Calling
  `add_module(name, ...)` after `delete_module(name)` in the same save now
  cancels the pending delete and treats the operation as a source rewrite,
  matching Excel's own behaviour. `serialize_project_stream` additionally
  scrubs duplicate `Module=` and workspace declarations on every structural
  save, healing files that were corrupted by earlier versions.

### Added

- `demo/` folder containing a runnable end-to-end demo
  (`push_demo_module.py` + `test_macro_workbook.xlsm` + `demo.md`).
- New regression tests:
  - `TestCompress.test_full_chunk_emitted_as_token_compressed_not_raw` and
    `TestCompress.test_long_module_round_trip_through_excel_save` verify
    that no raw chunks are produced for realistic VBA source.
  - `TestLargeModuleFixture` uses an Excel-authored 16 KB module as an
    empirical anchor and round-trips it through pyOpenVBA's saver.
  - `test_delete_then_readd_same_name_does_not_duplicate_project_decl` and
    `test_save_heals_preexisting_duplicate_project_declarations` cover the
    PROJECT-stream fix.
- `tests/live_excel_testing/large_vba_module.xlsm` fixture (Excel-authored
  reference for multi-chunk module compression).

## [1.0.0] - 2026

Initial public release. Pure-Python read/write support for VBA projects
inside `.xlsm`, `.xlsb`, and `.xls` containers, covering CFB parsing,
MS-OVBA compression, module add/edit/rename/delete, `PROJECT`/`PROJECTwm`
serialization, `_VBA_PROJECT` cache invalidation, and round-trip
preservation including password-protected projects.
